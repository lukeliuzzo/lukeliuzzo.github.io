This study uses the AIKEF hybrid simulation model to investigate Pluto’s interaction with the solar wind during the New Horizons flyby of Pluto.We show that the large gyroradii of ions near Pluto generate non-negligible asymmetries in Pluto’s plasma and magnetic environment, and any modeling attempts must consider these asymmetric features.
