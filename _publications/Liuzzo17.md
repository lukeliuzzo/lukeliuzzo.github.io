TThis study focused on the final four flybys of Callisto during the Galileo Mission. By using the AIKEF hybrid simulation model, we determined that no signatures of Callisto’s subsurface ocean were detected in magnetometer data during the C21, C22, C23, and C30 flybys. This study also constrained the geometry of future flybys of Callisto that aim to detect the moon’s inductive response in magnetic field data.
