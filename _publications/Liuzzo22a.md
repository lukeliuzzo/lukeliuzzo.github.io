In this study, we use more than ten years of data from the THEMIS-ARTEMIS mission to constrain the ambient lunar plasma environment while embedded within the terrestrial magnetotail. We identify three predominant distributions of the plasma (corresponding to the magnetosheath, lobes, and plasma sheet), for which we calculate statistical properties of the local magnetic field, plasma bulk velocity, number density, and temperature. In addition, we compare and contrast the lunar plasma environment within the tail to the environments experienced by various outer planet moons.
