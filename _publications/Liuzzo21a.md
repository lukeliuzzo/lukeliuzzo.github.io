This study focuses on the interaction of Earth’s moon with the terrestrial magnetotail lobe plasma. We introduce a novel method to observe a previously hidden, low-energy magnetotail plasma population that may be related to outflow of Earth’s ionosphere. We also highlight the similarities between signatures of the lunar interaction with those at various outer planet moons.
