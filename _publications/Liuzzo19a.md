This study uses an energetic ion test particle model to understand the effect that electromagnetic perturbations generated by Callisto’s thermal plasma environment has on energetic ion dynamics near the moon and accessibility of these ions to the moon. We find that over the course of a single synodic rotation of Callisto, the moon’s highly variable plasma environment has a significant on accessibility of Callisto to the energetic ion population.
