In this study, we investigate the interaction of Neptune’s moon, Triton, with its highly variable plasma environment. We identify a plasma interaction signature that has never before been observed at an outer planet moon: a depletion in the magnetospheric plasma density that is tilted out of the nominal location of Triton’s downstream wake, associated with flow deflection by an Alfvén wing that is located upstream of the moon. We also show that a magnetic field induced within an ionosphere and/or potential subsurface ocean likely dominates the local magnetic field perturbations.
